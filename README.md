# Topics in Control

This project contains the handouts for a summer course I taught at Dalian University of Technology. 

Each class is organized as follows. First, certain mathematical concept and tool are introduced and then one or two related papers will be dicussed. Some future reading materials are also provided.

This is by no means a comprehensive treatment of all topics and I would like to apologize beforehand if I missed any important references.
